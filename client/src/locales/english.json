If the sale does not take place, the amount will be fully refunded. 3. For each order of Products received by a Buyer, APARCULT will charge the buyer a commission of 20% with VAT included at the current rate. This commission charged to the buyer is automatically added to the price set by the Artist, except during an ongoing campaign. 4. Payment will be made by bank transfer to the Artist's bank account. 5. In the event that the Buyer does not confirm the receipt of the Product and in the absence of any complaint known to the Artist, it is assumed that the product has been received, and the transfer will be made to the Artist after a period of 14 days from the date of confirmation of the Product's receipt by the Buyer. 6. In case of a complaint by the Buyer, once the 14-day period has elapsed, as mentioned in the previous point, and the transfer has been made to the Artist, the Gallery, after evaluating the Buyer's complaint and if justified, may refund the Buyer the full value of the ordered Product. The amount refunded by the Gallery to the Buyer will be debited to the Artist, who must make the payment to the existing account between the Artist and the Gallery or through any other means agreed between the Gallery and the Artist within a maximum period of 14 days."
